Meteor exercise

The is an exercise for me to learn Meteor. 

It allows the user to interactively add, change and delete form controls, and to add, change and delete records using the form.

This application is running at sjhalasz03.meteor.com but please note that all changes you make there to data structure and data values are public and global to all users.
