Meteor exercise

The is an exercise for me to learn Meteor. 

It allows the user to interactively add, change and delete form controls, and to add, change and delete records using the form.

The code is saved at [this github repository](https://github.com/sjhalasz/magrathean). The code is live at [this Meteor site](http://sjhalasz03.meteor.com). Please note that all changes you make at the live site to data structure and data values are public and global to all users.
