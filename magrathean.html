This is a Meteor html file. 

The following is ordinary HTML but with references to Meteor templates e.g.
     {{> a_template_name }}.  The templates themselves are defined later in the file.

<body>
<!--  A container is recommended for Meteor -->
  <div class="container">
  {{>main}} <!-- everything starts with a root Meteor template -->
  </div>
</body>

<!--  Below are the Meteor templates referenced above -->
  
<!-- this is the root Meteor template for everything -->
<template name="main">
  {{#if definition}} {{! if in definition mode, allow switching to preview mode}}
    <button class="preview">Switch to Preview Mode</button>
  {{else}} {{! in preview mode...}}
    <button class="definition">Switch to Definition Mode</button> {{! allow switching to definition mode}}
  {{/if}} {{! end of #if definition}}

  {{#if definition}} {{! if in definition mode, show introductory explanation}}
    <h3> Magrathean Table Maker - A Meteor Learning Exercise</h3>
    This learning exercise allows the creation of tables and creating and editing of fields and records. For full explanation see <a href="magrathean.md" target="_blank">this document.</a>
  {{/if}} {{! end of #if definition; login follows and will appear in preview mode...}}

  <br>{{>loginButtons}} {{! the login package control for creating account and logging in}}
  You don't need to create a login to make changes, but if you do log in, 
  your user id will be recorded and reported as making the update.

  {{#if definition}} {{! if in definition mode, continue showing table/view/field definition stuff...}}
    {{>tableSelect}}  {{! template for selecting table and view}}
    {{>fieldUpdate}}  {{! template for adding/changing field definitions}}    
  {{/if}} {{! end of #if definition; the following will appear in preview mode...}}

  <br>{{>recordUpdate}}  {{! template for adding/changing/navigating records in both definition and preview}}
  {{! the following are helpful explanations...}}
    <ul>
    <li>The Back and Next buttons move through records already saved for the form above. The New button is for entering a new record.</li>
      <li>After entering or changing the values of the fields, click the Add/Change Record
        button to save the changes for the record.</li>

  {{#if definition}} {{! the following explanations are apropos definition mode only...}}
      <li>To the left of each field are several controls. The first two controls relate to the field definition.
      The &#10007; button will delete the field. The &#9998; button will copy the field
        definition into the field definition form above where you can make changes.</li>
      <li>The next three controls define how the fields are treated in the current view. 
        The checkbox is to show or hide a field in the current view. 
        In definition mode, the fields are still shown but are disabled.
        In live mode they would not be shown at all.
        The up and down arrows are to move
        the ordering of the field up and down in the view. </li>
        <li> The next two controls define how records are treated in the current view. 
          The select control lets you sort the records ascending
      or descending. The filter input will filter records that match exactly what you enter there.
      Only one field can have a sort and only one field can have a filter, so when you set them,
          they are removed from any field that previously had the sort or filter.</li>
